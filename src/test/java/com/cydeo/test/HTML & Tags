What is an ATTRIBUTE?

WHAT IS A WEB ELEMENT?
•Every single thing we see on the page is a web element of its own.
•Such as: links, buttons, input boxes, images, headers


ANCHOR TAG : <a>

•<a> tag allows us to create links on html page
•<a> tag is a paired tag.
•<a> tag MUST have an href attribute within.
•The text passed inside of the href attribute's value will be where the user taken 

<table> tag
•This tag allows us to create HTML tables on the page
•By itself it is not enough, we need to use <tr>, and <td> (<th>)
•HTML tables are created first ROW BY ROW, than cells are created within rows.
•Tables also should have head and body section.
•<table> </table> : creates the table

•<thead> </thead> : contains header information

•<tbody> </tbody> : actual content of the table goes here

•<tr> : - stands for "table row"
- creates each row
- however many tr we create, that many rows we will have in the table

- •<td> : - stands for "table data"
- allows us to create cells within the rows

- •<th> : - stands for "table header"
- allows us to crate cells just like <td> but it will also make the content "bolded" 
and  "centered"

<div> </div>
•div tag is commonly used as a container to style group of web elements
•it is a block element which means it goes all the way to right
•it is just a container to group and apply different stylings, fonts, colors to web 
elements.

<span> </span>
•span is very similar to div.
•it is used as smaller container to give certain styling to parts of the web element 
without disrupting the rest of the web element
•span is inline element (not block element)

<input>  tag: 
•input tags are used to let user enter some form of input.
•the type of the input accepted from user is determined by the value we pass into "type" 
attribute.

syntax: <input type="text"> 
--> to accept text from user
<input type="password"> 
--> to accept text from user,
--> the text will be hidded as password
<input type="button">
--> to create button on the page
<input type="checkbox"> 
--> to create checkbox on the page
<input type="radio"> 
--> to create radio button on the page

<select> </select>  tag:
- Allows us to create dropdowns in the HTML page.
- By itself it is not enough. We must use <option> tag to create different options 
displayed for user.
syntax:
<select>

<options> TEXT 1 </options>
<options> TEXT 2 </options>
<options> TEXT 3 </options>
</select>
